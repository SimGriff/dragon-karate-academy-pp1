For my first project I decided to promote a fictional karate club in my local area. The aim of the website is to encourage new members to join, providing information about the club and the benefits of karate training. Information about training times is also provided for new and existing members. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, ensuring that it targets a wide audience.

Both #990000 and #373940 were tested as background colours with #ffffff text, both passed on the contrast checker on the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) website ensuring excellent readability. All other text on the site was #373940 on a white background, which also passed the contrast checker.

  * Typography

    1. The Roboto font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto has been used for all headings in the site.
    2. Roboto-strong clean lines, with gentle curves is a popular font that is familiar to user and was used throughout the main text in the site. Google fonts suggested Oswald as a good pairing for this font and has been designed to be used on various devices. This font was used in all headings including the logo.

    1. The main hero image is designed to attract new members with its inspirational image of karate training.
    2. One of the intensions of the site was to attract members of all ages, images of children practicing karate and enjoying themselves were included in the site.

## Testing

Throughout the project I have been using DevTools on the Chrome browser to test changes to the HTML and CSS code. I have committed regularly and included detailed messages detailing the changes made.

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

### W3C Markup Validator results

 + Home Page

No errors were returned for all HTML or CSS across all tests. 

### Lighthouse Testing
For the Lighthouse testing Best Practices only reached a score of 87, with the message 'Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe'. 

![Lighthouse first test](docs/testing/lighthouse-first-run.png)

When I read more into this I found that when you link to a page on another site using the target="_blank" attribute, you can expose your site to performance and security issues. The advice given was to add rel="noopener" to my target="_blank" links to avoids these issues. Once this was done the following results were achieved;

![Lighthouse successful test](docs/testing/lighthouse-success.png)


### Manual Testing

This website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. The site was also tested across multiple devices to ensure all links and styling worked correctly and to ensure responsiveness across the devices. All features on the page were tested to ensure functionality was intact. Testing was carried out on an Apple iPhone, Apple iPhone 13, Apple iPad Pro, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, Samsung Galaxy A51, & Windows 10 Desktop.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs
During testing then Home page did not display four alternating columns of text and image as intended. I was initially unable to discover the issue, my mentor suggested that I need to check that I hadn't inadvertently overwritten my Bootstrap Grid. I discovererd that this was the case, I had overcompensated with the margins on the sections and this had resulted in there only being enough width for three columns on the page. I removed the offending margins from the custom classes I had created and this resolved the issue.

There was also an issue with the main logo, it was permanently underlined in blue along with a blue font colour instead of the intended white. Eventually I discovered the problem, a simple typo, the Bootstrap Nav Bar had been incorrectly shown as _nabar-brand_** instead of _navbar-brand_**. As tsoon as I fixed the typo, the issue was resolved.
